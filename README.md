> We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).<br>
> After you make your own repository, wait about 20 seconds and refresh. I will go to the next step.
